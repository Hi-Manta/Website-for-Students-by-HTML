        <br><br>Welcome to my portfolio. I'm Learning HTML with the channel name <i>Apna College</i>.
        <br>I connected two more of my pages. One is for my Educational background and the other one is for my Personal Details. 
        <br>I know this homepage sucks, but check my other pages. Those two are better than this. Hoping you will like those.
        <br>If you think why I wrote my name twice first, because I was copying James Bond. I'm not a big fan though.
        <br>Ok see you soon.... 
        <big>Bye</big>
